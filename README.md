# Ontronix-Ps4-Emulator
Ontronix is a ps4 emulator based on recompilation and interperatation. This means that it is extremely slow but can be fast to develop. At the current moment it is built with python and librarys that talk directly to the graphics card for fast speeds. As of the current moment the future of ontronix is undecided for concerns over piracy. The emulator can currently recompile a handfull of roms and run a few of that batch at 10fps or more. Games.txt has all the games that run. The source code is currently being updated.

Also there is 2 versions of ontronix there is a compiled python release and a web python release that can barely run at 5fps. The web release will be released very soon with a handfull of *legal roms*.
